# 3D-UE4-GAME
3D game made using blueprints on UE4

The entire game was modeled by me <br>
Didnt really added any texture other then in the bridge door <br>
It was a simple game that i created to get to know the engine

You can take a look at this video to watch the game itself, the modeling and rigging of the main character <br>
